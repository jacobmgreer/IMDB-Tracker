        <b>American Film Institute</b>
        <h3>100 Years...100 Movies</h3>
        <p>"A 'definitive selection of the 100 greatest American movies of all time, as determined by more than 1,500 leaders from the American film community.' The 400 Nominated Films (original) were feature-length fictional movies produced between 1912 and 1996 'with the goal of amassing a capsule of the first 100 years of American cinema, across decades and across genres.'"</p>
        <p>
         Two versions of the list exist: the original 1998 selection and another a 10th Anniversary selection in 2007 (added eligibility from 1997 to 2005).

        <b>Chicago Sun-Times</b>
        <h3>Roger Ebert</h3>
        <p>"One of the gifts a movie lover can give another is the title of a wonderful film they have not yet discovered. Here are more than 300 reconsiderations and appreciations of movies from the distant past to the recent past, all of movies that I consider worthy of being called 'great.'" A series of 4 books were published in 2003, 2006, 2011, and 2016.</p>
        <p>
        Online and in-print, Roger Ebert recommended 364 films as "Great Movies."
        </p>

        <b>Cannes Film Festival</b>
        <h3>Palme d'Or Winners</h3>
        <p>"The Festival de Cannes has remained faithful to its founding purpose: to draw attention to and raise the profile of films, with the aim of contributing towards the development of cinema, boosting the film industry worldwide and celebrating cinema at an international level." The first festival was held in 1946, though it was originally scheduled for 1939 (but was postponed by France entering WWII).</p>

        <b>Private Distribution Company</b>
        <h3>The Criterion Collection</h3>
        <p>"We aim to reflect the breadth of filmed expression. We try not to be restrictive or snobby about what kinds of films are appropriate. An auteur classic, a Hollywood blockbuster, and an independent B horror film all have to be taken on their own terms. All we ask is that each film in the collection be an exemplary film of its kind."</p>
